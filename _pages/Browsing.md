##### Disclaimer:

* We are not lawyers, and this is not legal advice.
* Technology is constantly evolving, and this information could be outdated at any moment.
* Following this advice does not guarantee anonymity against every threat.
* You accept the responsibility for your actions and the repercussions of following this advice.

That said, **we believe all individuals should have awareness in regards to their personal privacy**, and browsing activity is one of the most exploited areas of the internet.

There are many reasons a person may want or need anonymity. For more information about such cases, **[The Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en)** has great demonstrations of several legitimate applications.

**Level 1 - Basic Private Browsing**

</summary>

This is where most general users will be. These recommendations will only be useful against other non-technical threats. If you have any concerns about privacy that goes beyond the most basic protection, realize this level will do ZERO to protect you from a more sophisticated threat. If you're using a public terminal you'll definitely want to follow these steps.

##### Use your browser in “private” mode. 

This prevents your browser from saving a browsing history and caching any cookies or data. Once you end your session and close the browser window, all local evidence is gone.

**PLEASE REMEMBER:** *an IT admin at work, a user on your local network, an ISP, and state-level agencies can still capture packets and analyze your traffic. A majority of this traffic is unencrypted. If you care about this, escalate to a higher level.*
