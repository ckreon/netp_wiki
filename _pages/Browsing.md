Browsing Anonymously
====================

A walk-through of safe(r) browsing recommendations.
--------------------------------------------------

##### Disclaimer:

* We are not lawyers, and this is not legal advice.
* Technology is constantly evolving, and this information could be outdated at any moment.
* Following this advice does not guarantee anonymity against every threat.
* You accept the responsibility for your actions and the repercussions of following this advice.

That said, **we believe all individuals should have awareness in regards to their personal privacy**, and browsing activity is one of the most exploited areas of the internet.

There are many reasons a person may want or need anonymity. For more information about such cases, **[The Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en)** has great demonstrations of several legitimate applications.

##### This guide will provide practical advice for multiple threat-levels.

| Threat | Description |
|:-------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Level 1 | Spouse, Parents, Boss, etc. Most likely not illegal, but may be unethical/taboo. |
| Level 2 | Privacy/identity concerns, ISP logging, geographic restrictions. |
| Level 3 | Law enforcement, journalists, bloggers, activists, lawyers. |
| Level 4 | Whistle-blowers, intelligence operators, state-level threats. |

Level 1
--------------------------------------------------

This is where most general users will be. These recommendations will only be useful against other non-technical threats. If you have any concerns about privacy that goes beyond the most basic protection, realize this level will do ZERO to protect you from a more sophisticated threat. If you're using a public terminal you'll definitely want to follow these steps.


##### Use your browser in “private” mode. 

This prevents your browser from saving a browsing history and caching any cookies or data. Once you end your session and close the browser window, all local evidence is gone.

**PLEASE REMEMBER:** *an IT admin at work, a user on your local network, an ISP, and state-level agencies can still capture packets and analyze your traffic. A majority of this traffic is unencrypted. If you care about this, escalate to a higher level.*
